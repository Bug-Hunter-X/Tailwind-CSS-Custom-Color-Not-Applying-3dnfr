# Tailwind CSS Custom Color Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using custom colors in Tailwind CSS.  The custom color is defined, but it doesn't seem to be applied in the HTML.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, leading to the color not being applied correctly. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation.
